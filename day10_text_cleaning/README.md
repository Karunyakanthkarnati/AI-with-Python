# Python AI Text Cleaning (Day 10)

This project focuses on **text preprocessing for AI/NLP systems** using basic Python.
It demonstrates how raw user text is cleaned before being used in
AI pipelines such as NLP, RAG, and prompt engineering.

## Topics Covered
- String normalization (lowercasing)
- Removing punctuation
- Splitting text into words
- Counting words
- Extracting unique words

## Why This Matters for AI
AI models do not understand raw text directly.
Text must be cleaned and standardized before analysis or prompting.

## Folder Structure
- day10_text_cleaning/ → Python programs
- sample_inputs/ → example text files

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals
- Safe string manipulation
- AI-style text preprocessing
